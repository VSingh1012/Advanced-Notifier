# Advanced-Notifier
A specialized application built for an Audiologist seeking to automate her message delivery based on clients' given hearing aids data. This application uses a frontend interface to allow direct data deposits to a backend system that checks the date to see if a notification is needed to be sent via email back to the audiologist notifying her of an expiring warranty on the client's hearing aids. Warranty is based on the status of the hearing aids, either in need of repair or fitting. Dates of reminder are assigned using the given dates of service for the hearing aids. 

Makes use of Python libraries such as pandas, customtkinter, and datetime.
